## Background 

A collaborative effort to flesh out a developer-friendly terms of service and/or to consider the alternatives.  Begun with [this thread on the US Government API listserve](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/0yix5bEWbFo).

## Recommended Models for a Developer Terms of Service
* [Model TOS](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/blob/master/developer_tos/vanilla_tos.md)
* [Non-TOS TOS](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/blob/master/developer_tos/non-tos.md)

## Threads
* [Initial Example ToS](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/blob/master/developer_tos/vanilla_tos-initial.md) - *This is an older terms of service that was in need of improvement and which served as the starting point for this effort.  The above [Model TOS](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/blob/master/developer_tos/vanilla_tos.md) is now recommended instead.*  
* [Initial Feedback and Collaboration](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/issues/1)
* [Discussion around the specific clauses that make up the Model TOS](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/pull/11/files)
* [TOS v. SLA?](https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/issues/10)
