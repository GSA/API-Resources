# API Terms of Service Agreement

The U.S. AGENCY ("AGENCY”) offers some of its public data in machine-readable format through an API, a service located at https://open.AGENCY.gov. Use of the data made available via the API is generally unrestricted (see “Data Rights and Usage”). However, the service through which we make that data available is offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the AGENCY Website Policies (http://www.AGENCY.gov/WebsitePolicies/default.htm).

## Scope
The service (“API” , or Application Programming Interface) through which you may access AGENCY public data is subject to these terms. Use of the API constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.

## Data Rights and Usage
Unless otherwise noted, the content, data, documentation, code, and related materials associated with the API is public domain and made available with a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) dedication. In short, AGENCY waives all rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. AGENCY makes no warranties about the work, and disclaims liability for all uses of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Some data from the API may not be public domain, such as copies of copyrightable works made available to the AGENCY by private entities. AGENCY may make these works available under the fair use provision of the Copyright Act or as a result of regulatory directives. Therefore, your rights to use those works may be similarly limited. Works where CC0 do not apply will be clearly marked by a warning in the relevant documentation (for example: “This data is not in the public domain. Third party copy rights may apply.”).

### Attribution
While not required, when using content, data, documentation, code, and related materials associated with the API in your own work, we ask that proper credit be given.

## Service Management

### Right to Limit
Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by AGENCY. These limitations are designed to manage load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse. If AGENCY reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be temporarily or permanently blocked. AGENCY may monitor your use of the API to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

### Service Termination
If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the API. AGENCY reserves the right (though not the obligation) to: (1) refuse to provide the API to you, if it is AGENCY’s opinion that use violates any AGENCY policy; or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the API at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

## Liability

### Disclaimer of Warranties
The API platform is provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. While we will do our best to ensure the service is available and functional at all times, AGENCY hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. AGENCY makes no warranty that data will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

### Limitations on Liability
In no event will AGENCY be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.

## Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between AGENCY and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by AGENCY.

## Disputes
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be governed by federal law.

## No Waiver Rights
AGENCY’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.
